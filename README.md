# 🚀 open-responses-server

A plug-and-play server that speaks OpenAI’s Responses API—no matter which AI backend you’re running.  

Ollama? vLLM? LiteLLM? Even OpenAI itself?  
This server bridges them all to the OpenAI ChatCompletions & Responses API interface.  

In plain words:  
👉 Want to run OpenAI’s Coding Assistant (Codex) or other OpenAI API clients against your own models?  
👉 Want to experiment with self-hosted LLMs but keep OpenAI’s API compatibility?  

This project makes it happen.  
It handles stateful chat, tool calls, and future features like file search & code interpreter—all behind a familiar OpenAI API.

✅ Supports OpenAI’s new Coding Assistant / Codex that requires Responses API.  
✅ Built for innovators, researchers, OSS enthusiasts.  
✅ Enterprise-ready: scalable, reliable, and secure for production workloads.
