# 🚀 open-responses-server

A plug-and-play server that speaks OpenAI’s Responses API—no matter which AI backend you’re running.  

Ollama? vLLM? LiteLLM? Even OpenAI itself?  
This server bridges them all to the OpenAI ChatCompletions & Responses API interface.  

In plain words:  
👉 Want to run OpenAI’s Coding Assistant (Codex) or other OpenAI API clients against your own models?  
👉 Want to experiment with self-hosted LLMs but keep OpenAI’s API compatibility?  

This project makes it happen.  
It handles stateful chat, tool calls, and future features like file search & code interpreter—all behind a familiar OpenAI API.

# ✨ Why use this?

✅ Acts as a drop-in replacement for OpenAI’s Responses API.  
✅ Lets you run any backend AI (Ollama, vLLM, Groq, etc.) with OpenAI-compatible clients.  
✅ MCP support around both Chat Completions and Responses APIs
✅ Supports OpenAI’s new Coding Assistant / Codex that requires Responses API.  
✅ Built for innovators, researchers, OSS enthusiasts.  
✅ Enterprise-ready: scalable, reliable, and secure for production workloads.

# 🏗️ Quick Install

Latest release on PyPI:

```
pip install open-responses-server
```

Or install from source:

```
pip install uv
uv venv
uv pip install .
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"  # dev dependencies
```

Run the server:

```
# Using CLI tool (after installation)
otc start

# Or directly from source
uv run src/open_responses_server/cli.py start
```

Docker deployment:

```
# Run with Docker
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e OPENAI_BASE_URL_INTERNAL=http://your-llm-api:8000 \
  -e OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key \
  ghcr.io/teabranch/open-responses-server:latest
```

Works great with docker-compose.yaml for Codex + your own model.

# 🛠️ Configure

Minimal config to connect your AI backend:

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL_INTERNAL=http://localhost:11434  # Ollama, vLLM, Groq, etc.
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080            # This server's endpoint
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-mockapikey123456789            # Mock key tunneled to backend
MCP_SERVERS_CONFIG_PATH=./mcps.json              # Path to mcps servers json file 
```

Server binding:
```
API_ADAPTER_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_ADAPTER_PORT=8080
```
Optional logging:
```
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
LOG_FILE_PATH=./log/api_adapter.log
```

Configure with CLI tool:
```
# Interactive configuration setup
otc configure
```

Verify setup:
```
# Check if the server is working
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
```

Let’s build something powerful—together.

## Agent Skills

The server supports **agent skills** -- local script-based tools that the LLM can invoke during conversations. Skills follow the Claude Code skill directory standard. **This feature is off by default.**

### Enabling Skills

Set these environment variables (or add to `.env`):

```bash
SKILLS_ENABLED=true
SKILLS_DIR=/path/to/your/skills
SKILLS_EXEC_TIMEOUT=30   # optional, default 30 seconds
```

### Skill Directory Structure

Each skill lives in its own directory under `SKILLS_DIR`:

```
skills/
  my-skill/
    SKILL.md        # Required: YAML frontmatter + instructions
    scripts/        # Required: executable scripts (bash, python, etc.)
    references/     # Optional: reference documentation
```

### SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

## Instructions

Detailed usage instructions for the LLM.
```

### How It Works

1. At startup the server scans `SKILLS_DIR` and registers each skill as a tool
2. Skills are injected into LLM requests alongside MCP tools
3. When the LLM calls a skill tool, the server executes the specified script
4. Script output is returned as the tool result

Each skill becomes a tool named `skill__<name>` with parameters `script` (which script to run) and `args` (command-line arguments).

### Security

- **Off by default** -- must set `SKILLS_ENABLED=true` explicitly
- Scripts are confined to their skill’s `scripts/` directory (path traversal blocked)
- No shell execution (`shell=True` is never used)
- Only executable files can be run
- Configurable timeout prevents runaway scripts
